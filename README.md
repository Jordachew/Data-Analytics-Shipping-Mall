# Inspiration

A shipping agency or shipping agent is the designated person or agency held responsible for handling shipments and cargo, and the general interests of its customers, at ports and harbors worldwide, on behalf of ship owners, managers, and charterers. The age of e-commerce has cause a surge is drop shipments, online transactions and imports through courier services. In the mids of this multiple businesses (registered and unregistered) offers the service. Do we know which one to choose, how do we know the level of service offering and how can we speak to the KPI(service, location, or price) that is important to you the customer.

# Problem
There are more than 50 shipping agencies all over the island of Jamaica. This poses a challenge to many Jamaicans who are constantly trying to find a suitable courier service that suit their personal and business needs. These needs fluctuate based on timing, pricing and comfort levels. Some persons are willing to wait for their packages as long as the price is economical. While others who are not willing to wait, are willing to pay more for a quicker delivery time. At the end of the day how does one know which shipping agency is the cheapest, the quickest, the friendliest or even air conditioned without first having to sign up with the agency? This is where Shipping Mall solves this problem and provides all the information without anyone having to sign up or pay any money thus preventing an experience they were trying to avoid in the first place. Just because one person say this company is the best does not mean it is the best for all persons. Each customer is unique in their preferences and so Shipping Mall has to allow each individual to decide on their own by providing all the information for their perusal. The problem Shipping Mall solves is how to save time and money for fellow Jamaicans utilizing courier services and how to create business advantage for the shipping agencies.

# Opportunity
Shipping Mall Data analystics is able to display analysis of shipping companies accross the island. Through the use of Google Studios connected to google analytics and google sheets, we were able to visualize the data is a user friendly manager. Google Data Studio turns your data into fully customizable informative reports and dashboards that are easy to read and share. Combining the power of Google Analytics, portability and convience of google sheet, ease and flexibility of Google form, all grounded by the power and security of Google Workspace, we were able to provide a very captivating output. Data collection is from customers all over the island who have previously used shipping services. Their reviews comprised of personal experiences that filled the major entities such as price, ambiance, parking, wait time, delivery option, customer service, communication, etc.; all necessary for the analysis to tailor its report.  In addition, the data is also scraped from the various shipping agencies websites. The API collects the rates and locations.

Additional Data is mined from both customer online review sites and shipping agency sites. The tool will help both potential customers to make better decisions and help the shipping agencies to build a competitive advantage among themselves. The tool shows trends in purchase patters, correlaton between price, quantity and location. It also focuses on service delivery with unique filter options to choose from.

# Challenges
Due to the limited time, we were not able to employ the use of scraping tools ot pull rates and address also reviews from google. 
Additionally, hosting the data in SQl would have been a prefered options
Programing skills of the group is limited but we were able to pull it off effectively. 

# Where do we see THE-SHIPPING-MALL(TSM) going
We foresee this as a important tool that can help shipping companies make decisions. Additionally, customers will be able to get very important insights. Organizations such as the shipping association, customs, JIS and STATIN would also be interested in the data and analysis we provide. We can monitize the opportunity by offering advertizing to shipping companies, referalls to their sites, clickbait and afilliated links.
